## Axiom

**LANGUAGE speaks itself. PRIMITIVES power SERVICES. MAGIC validates.**

---

## Primitives

```
COIN  → work/value (the unit)
CHAT  → communication (generates COIN)
EVO   → evolution (grows COIN)
```

---

## Services

```
VAULT  → stores COIN (private)
SHOP   → distributes COIN (public)
```

---

## Equations

```
COIN       = WORK
CHAT       = GENERATES COIN
EVO        = GROWS COIN
EVOLUTION  = COVERAGE + ROADMAP
LEARNINGS  = GRADIENTS
VAULT      = STORES COIN
SHOP       = DISTRIBUTES COIN
```

---

## Runtime

```
~/.canonic  → shared (device-level)
```

---

## Constraints

```
MUST      — required
MUST NOT  — prohibited
SHOULD    — recommended
MAY       — optional
```
