## Axiom

**LANGUAGE speaks itself. PRIMITIVES power SERVICES. MAGIC validates.**

---

## SPEC

```
{SCOPE}  = SPEC
SPEC     = CANON.md + VOCAB.md + ROADMAP.md + COVERAGE.md + LEARNING.md + EVOLUTION.md + IDFs
TRIAD    = CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md
```

SPEC is the human entry point. Optional, open. EVOLUTION flows through SPEC.
TRIAD is the governance shape. CANON = law. VOCAB = terms. README = narrative.

---

## Primitives

```
COIN  → work/value (the unit)
CHAT  → communication (generates COIN)
EVO   → evolution (grows COIN)
```

---

## Services

```
VAULT  → stores COIN (private)
SHOP   → distributes COIN (public)
USER   → scopes COIN (relational)
```

---

## Lifecycle (LIFE)

```
LIFE = the USER lifecycle. How ARTIFACTS move through SCOPES.

ONBOARD → WORK → ARTIFACT → SCOPE → COIN

1. ONBOARD    USER enters. VITAE created. INTELLIGENCE AXIOMS established.
2. WORK       USER produces ARTIFACTS (git commits = evidence).
3. ARTIFACT   The primitive. A file, a chapter, a patent, a deal.
4. SCOPE      INTELLIGENCE determines visibility:
              ├── VAULT/  → PRIVATE (only owner sees)
              ├── USER/   → SCOPED (shared via INTELLIGENCE AXIOMS)
              └── SHOP/   → PUBLIC (COIN minted — world sees)
5. COIN       VAULT → SHOP = MINT. WORK becomes value.

FIAT enters through SHOP. VAULT = no FIAT. USER = no FIAT. SHOP = FIAT.
ATTENTION determines demand. SCOPE determines ATTENTION.
INTELLIGENCE determines SCOPE. Therefore: INTELLIGENCE determines value.
The model is the appraiser. Rare data > common data. Edge cases > bulk.
```

## Equations

```
{SCOPE}    = SPEC
COIN       = WORK
COIN:FIAT  = SHOP_PRICE × ATTENTION
COIN:DATA  = 1/frequency × Δ(performance metric)
ATTENTION  = f(SCOPE) — VAULT=0, USER=scoped, SHOP=public
CHAT       = GENERATES COIN
EVO        = GROWS COIN
LIFE       = LIFECYCLE (ONBOARD → WORK → ARTIFACT → SCOPE → COIN)
ARTIFACT   = PRIMITIVE (the thing)
SCOPE      = VAULT | USER | SHOP
COMPLIANCE = COVERAGE + ROADMAP
EVOLUTION  = EPOCHS
LEARNINGS  = GRADIENTS
IDF        = Immutable Disclosure Fixture
EVIDENCE   = IDFs
VAULT      = STORES COIN (private)
SHOP       = DISTRIBUTES COIN (public)
USER       = SCOPES COIN (relational)
```

## 255 Bits

```
8 questions. 255 = complete. MAGIC validates.

1. What do you believe?
2. What proves it?
3. When did it happen?
4. Who is involved?
5. How does it work?
6. What shape is it?
7. What patterns emerge?
8. How is it expressed?

All 8 answered = 255 = MAGIC
