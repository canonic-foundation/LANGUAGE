## EPOCHS

### 001 Canonical Axioms

LANGUAGE spec created. Three axioms established: CANON.md (truth), VOCAB.md (terms), README.md (access). Root governance for the CANONIC paradigm. Everything begins here — the language defines the system, and the system defines itself through the language.

### 002 Runtime Definition

Runtime semantics added. How the language executes — not just what it says, but how it moves. The LANGUAGE became a living specification with execution rules, not just a static document.

---

### 003 255-Bit Structure

Pure structure rewrite. The 255-bit table introduced as the structural backbone. Templates for governance files crystallized. The LANGUAGE stopped describing structure and became structure.

### 004 Lifecycle Cleanup

Lifecycle cleanup. PUBLIC = TRUST. What lives inside the runtime stays inside the runtime. The public surface became clean, auditable, and honest.

### 005 Paradigm Distillation

Stripped to TRIAD + SPEC only. Nothing else. Every extraneous concept removed. The LANGUAGE distilled to its irreducible minimum — the paradigm emerged by subtraction, not addition.

### 006 EVOLUTION = MAGIC

TRIAD + SPEC finalized. The EVOLUTION concept integrated into the LANGUAGE itself. Intelligence tracking became a first-class primitive — not bolted on, but woven in. The system learned to remember its own growth.

### 007 Paradigm Declaration

CANONIC declared as a programming paradigm for governance. Not a framework, not a library — a paradigm. The LANGUAGE specification became the formal declaration of that paradigm.

### 008 Ghost Repo Sweep

canonic-shop migrated to canonic-foundation/SHOP. Ghost repositories swept clean. The LANGUAGE scope expanded to govern the full foundation structure, not just itself.

### 009 INTEL Compositions

EVOLUTION term and INTEL compositions added to VOCAB. The vocabulary grew to name what the system had already become — intelligence services with composable evolution tracking.

### 010 EVOLUTION → INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

EVOLUTION evolved from being part of the LANGUAGE spec to being an INTELLIGENCE SERVICE. INTEL → INTELLIGENCE → EVOLUTION. The service tracks scope history, epoch timelines, and galaxy data. EVOLUTION.md files are intelligence artifacts served by the EVOLUTION service — not governance files, not spec components. E bit = EVIDENCE (IDF exists), not EVOLUTION. The LANGUAGE defines LANGUAGE + LEARNING. EVOLUTION serves INTEL.
