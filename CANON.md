## Series A — Investment Terms

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| BASE | $1.55T (validated work, not speculation) |
| TAM | $38.5T (5 sectors addressable) |
| Standards | 70+ mapped to 8 governance primitives |
| Languages | 19 at COMPLIANT |
| Patents | 5 provisionals filed |
| Disclosures | 71 documented |
| Coverage | Validation complete |
| Services | 5 sector-specific CHATs |

```
BITCOIN = SPEC = $1.55T (speculation)
CANONIC = {SCOPE} >= $1.55T (validation)
∴ WORK > SPECULATION
```

## TAM by Vertical

| Vertical | TAM | Compliance Standards |
|----------|-----|---------------------|
| Health | $4.5T | HIPAA, GDPR, FDA, 21 CFR Part 11, HL7, FHIR |
| Finance | $26T | SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, Basel III, AML |
| Defense | $886B | ITAR, CMMC, FedRAMP, NIST 800-171 |
| AI/ML | $1.8T | EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001 |
| Tech | $5.3T | SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA |

```
Σ TAM = $38.5T
70+ standards → 8 governance primitives → 1 validation engine

LANGUAGE is the domain.
Programming and Idioms are verticals.
Everything transpiles to C.
One input: CANONIC (LANGUAGE)
One runtime: CANONIC (fixed, patented)
One validation: COMPLIANT

## The 8 Governance Primitives

| # | Primitive | Question | Artifact |
|---|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1 | DECLARATION | What do you believe? | CANON.md |
| 2 | EVIDENCE | What proves it? | EVIDENCE/ |
| 3 | TEMPORAL | When did it happen? | Git history, LEDGER |
| 4 | RELATIONS | Who's involved? | ORGS/, DEALS/ |
| 5 | OPERATIONS | How does it work? | workflows, processes |
| 6 | STRUCTURE | What shape is it? | schemas, patterns |
| 7 | LEARNING | What patterns emerge? | LEARNING/ |
| 8 | LANGUAGE | How is it expressed? | LANGUAGE/, VOCAB.md |

```
All 8 primitives satisfied = COMPLIANT

## 5 Layers of Protection

| Layer | Name | Mechanism | Access |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Public | THE MAGIC SERIES teaches governance | Everyone |
| 2 | Service | VaaS black box validation | Customers |
| 3 | Access | .canonic gated at ENTERPRISE | ENTERPRISE+ |
| 4 | Compiled | Runtime transpiles to binary | Never visible |
| 5 | Legal | 5 provisionals, 71 disclosures | Patented |

---

## Validation as a Service (VaaS)

```
INPUT: Your Scope
  → BLACK BOX (patented)
OUTPUT: Your Score (BLOCKED or COMPLIANT)
```

```
You don't see inside. You don't need to.
Your governance goes in. Your validation score comes out.
```

## THE MAGIC SERIES — 8 Books

| Book | Question | Emotion Arc | Transformation |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | What do you believe? | Confusion -> Clarity | Lost -> Grounded |
| 2 | What proves it? | Doubt -> Conviction | Hoping -> Knowing |
| 3 | When did it happen? | Scattered -> Ordered | Reactive -> Intentional |
| 4 | Who's involved? | Isolated -> Connected | Alone -> Supported |
| 5 | How does it work? | Overwhelmed -> Capable | Stuck -> Moving |
| 6 | What shape is it? | Formless -> Structured | Chaotic -> Architected |
| 7 | What patterns emerge? | Blind -> Seeing | Repeating -> Learning |
| 8 | How is it expressed? | Mute -> Articulate | Silent -> Speaking |

```
CHAOS + 8 QUESTIONS = MAGIC

QUESTION = BOOK
BOOK     = 8 CHAPTERS
CHAPTER  = 6 SECTIONS (AXIOM + STORY + THEORY + PRACTICE + EVIDENCE + BRIDGE)

Σ SERIES = 8 x 8 x 6 = 384 SECTIONS
```

### Release Schedule

| Book | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1 — DECLARATION | Available |
| 2 — EVIDENCE | Q1 |
| 3 — TEMPORAL | Q1 |
| 4 — RELATIONS | Q1 |
| 5 — OPERATIONS | Q2 |
| 6 — STRUCTURE | Q2 |
| 7 — LEARNING | Q2 |
| 8 — LANGUAGE | Q3 |

## CANONIC Beliefs (Book 1)

1. Governance creates value. Validated work is worth more than speculation.
2. 8 questions cover all governance. Answer them all, achieve COMPLIANT.
3. Everything composes from three primitives: COIN, CHAT, EVO.
4. Beliefs must be explicit. Write them in CANON.md or they don't exist.
5. Validation must be automated. If you can't test it, you can't enforce it.

---

## CANON.md Validation

```
A belief is VALID when:
1. It's written    → exists in CANON.md
2. It's specific   → can be tested
3. It's practiced  → evidence exists
4. It's enforced   → violations caught
```

## MAGIC Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Validation as a Service | Input -> MAGIC -> Output. Blackbox validation. |
| IP Protected | Guard the secret. Spread the MAGIC. |
| Pure Runtime | EVO reads LANGUAGE. Applies. Nothing else. |
| Distributed Ready | FOUNDATION -> DAO. Decentralized governance. |

## Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| .STORE/ | Series A page, investment pitch |
| FOUNDATION/ | Hub page, navigation, MAGIC display |
| BOOKS/ | THE MAGIC SERIES content |
| LANGUAGE/ | Defines evolution |
| LEARNING/ | Federated compute |

## Equations

```
{SCOPE}  = SPEC
SPEC     = CANON.md + VOCAB.md + LEARNING.md + ROADMAP.md + EVIDENCE/ + /SHOW
DESIGN   = /SHOW
USER     = ORG
ORG      = VITAE
CANONIC  = LANGUAGE
LANGUAGE = GATED STATE MACHINE
COIN     = WORK
MAGIC    = CANONIC ∩ LANGUAGE ∩ LEARNING
COMPLIANT = MAGIC
0        = BLOCKED
```

---

## Constraints

1. LANGUAGE MUST be minimal.
2. LEARNING MUST federate.
3. NO execution. Only definition.
4. Beliefs MUST be explicit — write them in CANON.md or they don't exist.
5. Validation MUST be automated — if you can't test it, you can't enforce it.
6. No logic in wrappers — all execution happens in the runtime.
7. Enterprise developers get access. Runtime is never visible.
