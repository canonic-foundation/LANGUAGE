# LANGUAGE — CANON

inherits: canonic-foundation
spec: LANGUAGE
tier: MAGIC
version: 2026-02

---

## Axiom

**PEOPLE govern. MACHINE executes. DESIGN speaks STRUCTURE.**

---

## TRIAD

```
CANON.md  = governance (what you believe)
VOCAB.md  = definitions (the words you use)
README.md = interface (what people see)
```

---

## SPEC

```
{SCOPE} = TRIAD
```

---

## Identity

```
CANONIC  = LANGUAGE
LANGUAGE = Gated State Machine
MAGIC    = CANONIC ∩ LANGUAGE ∩ LEARNING
```

---

## Structure

```
LANGUAGE/
├── CANON.md      — declaration (this file)
├── LANGUAGE.md   — primitives + templates
├── DESIGN.md     — visual expression
├── VOCAB.md      — controlled vocabulary
├── ROADMAP.md    — temporal evolution
├── LEARNING.md   — federated patterns
└── EVIDENCE/     — proof
```

---

## Constraints

1. MUST define all governance terms in VOCAB.md
2. MUST maintain TRIAD integrity (CANON.md + VOCAB.md + README.md)
3. SHOULD express structure through DESIGN — visual language is governance
4. MUST NOT introduce ungoverned vocabulary into active governance files
