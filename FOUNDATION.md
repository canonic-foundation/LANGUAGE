# FOUNDATION

inherits: canonic-foundation

---

## Axiom

**FOUNDATION governs LANGUAGE. LANGUAGE speaks itself.**

---

## Purpose

FOUNDATION evolves the protocol. It is the constitution.

---

## Scope

```
LANGUAGE.md   → the specification
VOCAB.md      → vocabulary
CANON.md      → canonical terms
ROADMAP.md    → evolution path
```

---

## Governance

FOUNDATION changes require:
- MUST preserve axioms
- MUST maintain backwards compatibility
- MUST NOT expose implementation
- SHOULD extend, not replace

---

## Rule

**FOUNDATION evolves LANGUAGE. LANGUAGE powers SERVICES. MAGIC validates.**
