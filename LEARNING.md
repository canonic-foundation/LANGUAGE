# LEARNING — FOUNDATION

inherits: canonic-foundation

---

## Axiom

**What patterns emerge? The patterns that govern.**

---

## What Gets Learned

| Pattern | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Constraint inheritance | How beliefs propagate across scopes |
| Governance coverage | Which primitives each scope satisfies |
| Spec compliance | How scopes evolve toward COMPLIANT |
| Vocabulary drift | When terms diverge from canonical definitions |

---

## How It Works

LEARNINGS = GRADIENTS. The foundation learns from every scope that inherits it. Patterns accumulate. Governance improves.

---

## The Rule

**Governance that doesn't learn repeats its failures.**
